# SHA-256 Hash Function and Cryptography Tools

This project implements an SHA-256 hash function to generate hash signatures for files and verify their integrity. Additionally, it includes implementations for classical encryption techniques: Caesar cipher and Vigenère cipher.

## Features

- **SHA-256 Hashing**
  - Generate SHA-256 hash for any file.
  - Verify the integrity of files by comparing their hash signatures.
  
- **Caesar Cipher**
  - Encrypt text using the Caesar cipher.
  - Crack Caesar cipher text to retrieve the original message.

- **Vigenère Cipher**
  - Encode text using the Vigenère cipher.
  - Crack Vigenère cipher text to retrieve the original message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `hashlib` (built-in, no installation required)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dineshsai05/Introduction_to_Cryptography.git
