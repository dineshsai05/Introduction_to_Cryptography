# SHA-256 Hash Function for File Signature Generation and Verification

This project implements an SHA-256 hash function to generate hash signatures for files and verify their integrity. It is built using Python and utilizes the built-in `hashlib` library to perform hashing operations.

## Features

- Generate SHA-256 hash for any file.
- Verify the integrity of files by comparing their hash signatures.
- Handle large files efficiently by reading them in chunks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `hashlib` (built-in, no installation required)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sha256-file-hasher.git
   cd sha256-file-hasher
